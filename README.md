 ## Description

 This is a command line application that is a basic logo maker. It uses Inquirer to prompt the user what they would like their logo to look like and Jest to run test on the application. The user can choose the shape of their logo, along with the text and the color of both the shape and text. The application can be invoked by using the command "node index".
